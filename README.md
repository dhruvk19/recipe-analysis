# What will my recipe be rated on food.com

## Checkpoint
1. We will be analyzing the **Recipes and Ratings** dataset as we feel this will apply to a larger audience. 
2. Plotly (see below)
3. We will be trying to predict the `rating` column. This will be a regression problem as the ratings are numerical, ranging from 0 to 5. 

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze past recipes/reviews to predict what a recipe will be rated on food.com. Our first dataset contains information about recipes, `recipes`, and the second is about the interactions with these recipes on food.com, `reviews`. We will discuss our datasets further below and how we used them to solve our problem. 

To approach this problem, we will first clean the data. Then, analyze specific factors that play a role in our `ratings` predictions, and test our models on these factors. 

This question is significant because if you're an aspiring chef, you want to ensure your meals appeal to a larger audience and also build a reputation on review websites like Food.com. Knowing how certain dishes perform would greatly impact the recipe choices chefs make. 

Our first dataset, `recipes`:


Our second dataset, `reviews`:
